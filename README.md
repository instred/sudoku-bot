# sudoku-bot

## Short description and goals for this project

I would like to create a bot, that can solve a 9x9 sudoku for me.
The project will involve:
  - Algorithms testing and choosing most optimal/fastest one
  - After the main algorithm is done, I'd like to implement this bot on a website, for ex. on sudoku.com
  - The bot will scrap/screenshot the 9x9 grid from webpage and input the data into my alg. Still not sure how I'm gonna implement this. Might add some basic AI model for the digit regonization proccess.
  - After it's done with solving it, it should automatically input the solved grid into the webpage back.

### TODO: More in depth description + quick tutorial how to run it
